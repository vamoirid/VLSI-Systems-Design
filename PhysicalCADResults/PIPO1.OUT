WARNING (XSTRM-20): Output Stream file '/software/cadence/users/user22/Desktop/PhysicalCADResults/DynLatchOpAmp.gds' already exists. It will be overwritten.

INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the viaMap option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the -viaMap option for preserving oaVia instances in a Stream Out - Stream In round trip. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.  For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.

INFO (XSTRM-180): You have not used the objectMap option. The design has instance(s) of at least one of following OpenAccess objects: oaBlockage, oaBoundary, oaRow, and oaMarker. Any information about these objects will not be translated into the generated stream file. Use the objectMap option to translate/preserve these objects using XStream. For details on the objectMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
INFO (XSTRM-317): The 'DynLatchOpAmpLib/DynLatchOpAmp/layout' has a pathSeg with diagonal orientation, or end style as custom or chamfer at (7035, 4675). This pathSeg will be translated as a boundary record in the GDS file during Stream Out.

WARNING (XSTRM-206): Path length 0.23 at location (2,0) on layer 7 is less than 1/2 of path width 0.60. The path would be written in Stream file as is. To resolve this, fix the reported path in the input design and run the translator again.
